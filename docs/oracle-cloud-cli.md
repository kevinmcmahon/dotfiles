The idiomatic best practice for installing the OCI CLI on Ubuntu 24.04 is to use the **Official Installation Script** provided by Oracle.

Because Ubuntu 24.04 enforces **PEP 668 (externally-managed-environments)**—which prevents you from using `pip install` globally—the official script is the best method because it automatically handles the creation of a dedicated **Python Virtual Environment (venv)** for the CLI, keeping your system Python clean.

Here is the step-by-step process:

### 1. Update and Install Dependencies
Ensure your system is up to date and has the necessary build tools.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl python3 python3-venv libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
```

### 2. Run the Official Installer
Run the following command to download and execute the installer script:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
```

### 3. Respond to Installer Prompts
During the installation, you will be asked several questions. For the "idiomatic" experience, the defaults are usually best:
- **Install Directory:** Press `Enter` (defaults to `~/lib/oracle-cli`).
- **Executable Directory:** Press `Enter` (defaults to `~/bin`).
- **Scripts Directory:** Press `Enter` (defaults to `~/bin/oci-cli-scripts`).
- **Update PATH:** Type **`Y`** and press `Enter`. This will add the CLI to your `.bashrc` so you can run the `oci` command from any terminal.

### 4. Refresh your Environment
To start using the CLI immediately without logging out, reload your bash configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 5. Verify the Installation
Check that the CLI is installed and check the version:
```bash
oci --version
```

---

### 6. Configuration (The "Setup")
Once installed, you must connect the CLI to your Oracle Cloud account. Run the interactive setup:
```bash
oci setup config
```
**You will need the following information from the OCI Console:**
1. **User OCID:** Found under *User Settings*.
2. **Tenancy OCID:** Found under *Tenancy Details*.
3. **Region:** (e.g., `us-ashburn-1`, `uk-london-1`).
4. **API Key:** The script will offer to generate a new RSA key pair for you. **Say Yes.**

After the script finishes, it will tell you where your **Public Key** is located. You must:
1. Go to the OCI Web Console.
2. Go to **Identity & Security** > **Users** > **User Details**.
3. Click **API Keys** > **Add API Key**.
4. Upload the `.pem` public key file generated by the script (usually in `~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem`).

### Alternative (Modern) Method: `pipx`
If you prefer to manage all your Python-based CLI tools via a single manager, **`pipx`** is the modern standard for Ubuntu 24.04.

1. **Install pipx:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install pipx
   pipx ensurepath
   ```
2. **Install OCI CLI:**
   ```bash
   pipx install oci-cli
   ```
*Note: This method is cleaner if you use many different Python tools, but the official script (Method 1) is better supported by Oracle’s troubleshooting documentation.*

### Why not use `apt install`?
As of now, Oracle does not maintain a native `.deb` repository for Ubuntu 24.04. Using the install script or `pipx` ensures you get the **latest version** directly from the source, which is critical for OCI as they release updates frequently to support new cloud services.
