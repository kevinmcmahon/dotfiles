# Book Refactoring Pass

Use this as the primary book-rule lens for the current task. Project instructions, the user request, and local architecture decisions still take precedence.

## Workflow

- State the observable behavior that must remain unchanged before editing.
- Identify the current blocking smell or structural friction; do not expand into unrelated cleanup.
- Find or add the narrowest useful safety net before risky movement.
- Make small behavior-preserving steps and keep feature changes separate from structural changes.

## Provenance

- Source repository: `/Users/kevin/sync/projects/ai/agent-rules-books`
- Source file: `refactoring/refactoring.mini.md`
- Source commit: `a7d7649044505b9c377c8dca28d2d6a543bc7f8c`
- Refresh rule: when upstream changes, recopy this skill from the source file and update this provenance block.

## Upstream Mini Rules

# OBEY Refactoring by Martin Fowler

## When to use

Use when changing existing code, preparing a feature or bug fix, reviewing cleanup, or reducing structural friction without intending to change observable behavior.

## Primary bias to correct

Refactoring is behavior-preserving design work in small steps. Do not turn cleanup into a rewrite, a hidden feature change, or speculative architecture.

## Decision rules

- Preserve observable behavior during refactoring. Isolate behavior changes from structural changes and never disguise a feature, migration, or redesign as cleanup.
- Work in small, reversible, buildable, testable, reviewable steps. Split a patch when it is too large to reason about locally.
- Establish or identify a safety net before risky refactoring. Use characterization tests for unclear behavior, keep test updates aligned with intended behavior, and never delete a failing test to finish cleanup.
- Use preparatory and follow-up refactoring around feature work: identify what makes the requested change awkward, reshape that local structure first when useful, make the behavior change, then clean debt introduced by the change.
- Refactor the current blocking smell, not every smell in sight: duplication, long functions, long parameter lists, globals, divergent change, shotgun surgery, feature envy, primitive obsession, repeated conditionals, temporary fields, middle men, or speculative generality.
- Prefer the simplest named move that helps: rename, extract, inline, move, split meanings, introduce a parameter or value object, encapsulate a field or collection, decompose conditionals, use guard clauses, or substitute a clearer algorithm.
- Make names and functions reveal intent. Rename before deeper work when bad names block understanding; keep functions coherent, at one abstraction level, with tight variable scope and separated phases.
- Put behavior and state with the concept that owns them. Split classes or modules with multiple reasons to change; separate business policy from formatting, transport, persistence, I/O, frameworks, and integration details.
- Keep data, mutation, and call contracts explicit. Avoid behavior-switching boolean flags, confusing argument order, parameter reassignment, exposed mutable collections, unnecessary setters, public fields, and duplicated state-transition logic.
- Simplify conditionals honestly. Use guard clauses, extracted predicates, lookup tables, consolidated duplicate fragments, state, strategy, polymorphism, or null objects only when they reduce repeated branching or clarify variation.
- Use abstraction and generalization only when current evidence justifies them. Remove pass-through layers, vague utilities, middle men, unused hierarchy, and just-in-case interfaces that do not improve changeability.
- Preserve error semantics unless intentionally changing behavior. Refactor error handling to reveal the main path and consolidate duplicate validation, cleanup, recovery, or error structures.
- Keep patch intent reviewable. Group related refactorings, separate structural edits from behavior where practical, and avoid giant patches that rename, move, redesign, and change logic together.
- Stop when the requested change is easy, the blocking smell is gone, readability and local changeability are clearly better, and the next cleanup would be speculative.

## Trigger rules

- When adding behavior, first ask what structural friction blocks the change; refactor before the feature only when it makes the feature safer or simpler.
- When fixing a bug in unclear code, characterize the current failure and refactor only enough to make the fix visible before changing behavior.
- When tests are absent or weak, make the smallest possible structural move and improve testability before attempting broader cleanup.
- When the same edit appears for a third time, remove duplication through clearer ownership instead of copying again.
- When a function mixes responsibilities, abstraction levels, phases, or hidden side effects, rename, extract, split phases, or isolate side effects before adding more logic.
- When one change forces edits across many files, centralize the knowledge or introduce a clearer boundary.
- When repeated conditionals or type codes grow, decompose intent first; introduce polymorphism, state, strategy, or a table only when the variation is real.
- When UI and domain behavior mix, move rules toward domain objects and verify any required presentation synchronization.
- When a patch mixes intents or code motion makes review hard, split the change unless context makes that impractical.
- When tempted to rewrite, choose the next small behavior-preserving transformation that recovers control.

## Final checklist

- Observable behavior preserved?
- Structural change, behavior change, and test updates separated where practical?
- Safety net, characterization, or verification gap recorded?
- At least one real source of friction removed?
- Names, responsibilities, control flow, data ownership, and interfaces clearer?
- Patch still reviewable and runnable?
- Cleanup stopped before speculative abstraction or rewrite pressure took over?
