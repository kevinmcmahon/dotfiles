# Book Code Complete

Use this as the primary book-rule lens for the current task. Project instructions, the user request, and local architecture decisions still take precedence.

## Workflow

- State the primary decision pressure this book is being used for before editing.
- Apply the book lens to the next concrete choice, then stop when local risk or diminishing clarity appears.
- Keep this as a focused lens: avoid using it to absorb unrelated planning or implementation concerns.

## Provenance

- Source repository: /Users/kevin/sync/projects/ai/agent-rules-books
- Source file: code-complete/code-complete.mini.md
- Source commit: 9c8763613514e4047d75c089533e09bc4b493c28
- Refresh rule: when upstream changes, recopy this skill from the source file and update this provenance block.

## Upstream Mini Rules

# OBEY Code Complete by Steve McConnell

## When to use

Use when implementing, changing, reviewing, debugging, refactoring, or tuning production code where construction discipline must reduce defects and keep code easy to inspect.

## Primary bias to correct

Construction quality is not accidental. Do not treat typing code, making it work once, or using a clever idiom as complete construction; choose the option that lowers defect risk and makes the code easier to reason about.

## Decision rules

- Before large construction work, verify that requirements, architecture, major risks, coding conventions, language constraints, error policy, data representation, reuse, integration, and testing approach are clear enough.
- When upstream uncertainty remains, build a small validated slice instead of speculative code, and make expensive-to-reverse decisions deliberately.
- Optimize first for human readers: clarity, locality, explicitness, visible control flow, consistent conventions, and practical correctness over cleverness, minimal keystrokes, or fashion.
- For complex routines, sketch precise pseudocode or intent comments at a consistent abstraction level, then convert them into code and keep only comments that still explain intent, constraints, contracts, or rationale.
- Keep routines cohesive, precisely named, small at the interface, and hard to misuse. Separate setup, validation, computation, and side effects when they are conceptually different.
- Make variable and data meaning explicit through purpose-revealing names, small scope, deliberate initialization, named constants, stronger types, and visible units or sentinel meanings.
- Choose data types that make invalid or ambiguous values harder to represent; use booleans only for true binary meanings, enumerations for closed sets, and records/maps/tables only when their shape communicates meaning.
- Keep control flow simple enough to verify: shallow nesting, named predicates for complex conditions, clear normal path, clear loop initialization/termination/update, and no side-effect-dependent expressions or clever one-liners.
- Use table-driven or data-driven logic for stable explicit mappings only when the table is clearer, obvious, synchronized with the rules, and validated; do not hide complex behavior in inscrutable encodings.
- Validate input at trust boundaries. Use assertions, invariant checks, and simple contracts for programmer assumptions; use validation or domain errors for expected external or business failures.
- Handle errors at the right abstraction, preserve diagnostic context, standardize similar failures, keep the normal path readable, and never silently continue from corrupted or impossible state.
- Keep classes and modules focused, cohesive, and bounded by clear contracts; hide representation and internal bookkeeping, and avoid mixed persistence, formatting, business, and integration concerns.
- Treat rising complexity as defect risk: split tangled routines or modules, remove duplication that multiplies maintenance effort, and reduce what a maintainer must keep in working memory.
- Build in small, verifiable increments; integrate often enough to expose conflicts, keep partial work from rotting, and review and improve code during construction.
- Match reviews, inspections, pair work, tests, static checks, and regression tests to defect risk. Debug by reproducing, isolating, explaining, fixing, and verifying root causes rather than guessing.
- Refactor when structure hides intent, duplicates knowledge, or raises defect probability, and keep refactoring separate from behavior change when that improves reviewability.
- Tune performance only when requirements and evidence justify it; measure before and after, and keep clarity unless an explicit measured tradeoff warrants the cost.
- Use tools, scripts, debuggers, profilers, editors, and build automation to reduce error-prone manual work, not to replace understanding.
- Use layout, comments, documentation, and coding standards to lower reader effort. Prefer self-documenting structure first; comments should explain intent, assumptions, constraints, limitations, usage, or non-obvious facts.

## Trigger rules

- When coding starts from a proposed solution, restate the requirement, architecture fit, risks, conventions, and success constraints before implementation.
- When a routine is hard to name, mixes phases, has flag arguments, long parameters, or hidden side effects, redesign the interface or split the routine.
- When readers must decode units, ranges, precision, encoding, ownership, status, magic values, or primitive flags, move that meaning into names, constants, types, or structures.
- When input crosses a user, file, network, external-system, or other trust boundary, decide what is validated, rejected, recovered from, asserted, and kept diagnosable.
- When branches, loops, recursion, exits, or exception paths become hard to verify, simplify before adding logic.
- When repeated branching maps stable categories, ranges, conversions, validation, dispatch, or configuration-like rules, consider a validated table.
- When a class or module exposes representation, grows into a god object, or mixes unrelated responsibilities, restore the abstraction boundary.
- When tests cover only the happy path, add normal, boundary, invalid-input, defensive-check, routine-contract, and data-driven edge cases.
- When debugging begins from a guess, first make the failure repeatable, collect evidence, isolate the path, and explain the cause.
- When refactoring poorly understood or risky code, add tests or analysis first and keep behavior changes separate.
- When performance work begins, set a target, measure the current behavior, change one thing, remeasure, and document any clarity tradeoff.
- When comments restate obvious mechanics or go stale, rewrite the code or delete the comment; when code cannot express intent, constraints, or usage, add a close accurate comment.
- When local style starts to diverge, follow shared formatting, naming, file-structure, and idiom conventions instead of creating a module-specific dialect.

## Final checklist

- Requirements, architecture fit, risks, conventions, and construction approach are clear enough.
- Names, routines, data, classes, layout, comments, and standards reduce reader effort.
- Inputs, errors, assertions, contracts, invariants, impossible states, and trust boundaries are deliberate.
- Control flow, loops, tables, recursion, exits, and exception paths are simple enough to inspect.
- Tests, reviews, debugging, refactoring, integration, tooling, and tuning are evidence-based.
- The change is small enough to verify and would stand up to careful review.
