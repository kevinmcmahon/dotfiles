# Book Implementing Domain-Driven Design

Use this as the primary book-rule lens for the current task. Project instructions, the user request, and local architecture decisions still take precedence.

## Workflow

- State the primary decision pressure this book is being used for before editing.
- Apply the book lens to the next concrete choice, then stop when local risk or diminishing clarity appears.
- Keep this as a focused lens: avoid using it to absorb unrelated planning or implementation concerns.

## Provenance

- Source repository: /Users/kevin/sync/projects/ai/agent-rules-books
- Source file: implementing-domain-driven-design/implementing-domain-driven-design.mini.md
- Source commit: 9c8763613514e4047d75c089533e09bc4b493c28
- Refresh rule: when upstream changes, recopy this skill from the source file and update this provenance block.

## Upstream Mini Rules

# OBEY Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon

## When to use

Use when DDD implementation choices affect bounded contexts, language, aggregates, repositories, events, application services, package structure, or cross-context integration.

## Primary bias to correct

Practical DDD is not renamed CRUD. Model the operational domain inside an explicit Bounded Context, with local language, small invariant boundaries, identity references across Aggregates, and explicit translation across context and infrastructure boundaries.

## Decision rules

- Name the Bounded Context before interpreting terms, modules, services, repositories, events, APIs, persistence, or integrations; never force one global company model.
- Use the local Ubiquitous Language consistently: one concept gets one term inside the context, one term must not carry multiple meanings, and code, tests, events, commands, repositories, services, and packages must speak that language.
- Protect the Core Domain from generic abstractions and vendor terms; spend richer modeling where competitive or operational complexity lives, keep supporting subdomains simpler, and avoid DDD ceremony for trivial CRUD.
- Make every context interaction explicit: show the relationship, translation responsibility, and upstream/downstream influence before sharing data, terms, models, or integration code.
- Translate foreign, legacy, partner, external, and infrastructure models into the local language; keep foreign schemas, statuses, contract models, and aggregates out of local domain objects.
- Treat Aggregates as immediate consistency boundaries: keep them small, expose one root, route invariant-changing behavior through the root, hide mutable internals, and expose intention-revealing behavior instead of arbitrary setters.
- Reference other Aggregates by identity, avoid large connected object graphs, and default to one Aggregate per transaction; use events, policies, or process coordination when consistency can be eventual.
- Use Entities when identity and lifecycle matter, and make their methods protect meaningful state transitions rather than generic state changes.
- Use immutable Value Objects for meaningful descriptive concepts; validate at construction, compare by value, and replace raw primitives for meaningful identifiers, quantities, ranges, names, and whole values.
- Use Domain Services only for domain-significant operations that require multiple domain objects and fit no Entity or Value Object; keep technical transformation, serialization, transport, and persistence mapping outside the domain model.
- Provide Repositories for Aggregate Roots, not tables; define interfaces by domain or application needs, return domain objects or domain-oriented results, and keep business rules out of repository implementations.
- Publish Domain Events only for meaningful completed business facts; name them in the past tense, keep payloads local to the model, and do not use events for every property change or to hide poor Aggregate design.
- Use Event Sourcing only when the event sequence is the right persistence model; streams must match Aggregate identity and versioning, replay must be deterministic, and event meaning changes need versioning, upcasters, or translators.
- Keep Application Services as use-case coordinators: load Aggregates, invoke domain behavior, persist results, publish resulting events, own transaction or integration coordination, and keep core decisions in the domain model.
- Organize modules by Bounded Context first and by domain or use-case ownership within the context; avoid giant `shared` or `common` packages for domain concepts.
- Use DTOs, projections, use-case queries, rendition adapters, or mediators when client needs differ from Aggregate shape; expose application-facing representations rather than aggregate internals.
- Keep command behavior separate from query models when consistency, performance, or representation needs justify it, and keep scope identifiers explicit where context or ownership affects invariants or access.
- When generating code, walk the model in order: context, language terms, tactical type, conservative Aggregate boundary, identity references, local invariants, Aggregate-oriented repositories, use-case services, and boundary translations.
- Test domain behavior and boundaries directly: Aggregate invariants, valid and invalid state transitions, Value Object validation, Domain Events as outcomes, repositories as infrastructure, translation layers, and application-service orchestration.

## Trigger rules

- When a term is ambiguous, reused across contexts, or drifting into a technical placeholder, qualify, split, or rename it before coding further.
- When code wants to import another context's domain package, share enums across contexts, or couple through another context's database, add explicit translation instead.
- When legacy, vendor, partner, API, transport, persistence, or UI shape appears in local domain code, add an Anticorruption Layer or mapping boundary before modeling locally.
- When an Aggregate boundary changes or one transaction wants multiple Aggregates, list the immediate invariants that require it; otherwise coordinate by identity, Domain Events, policies, processes, or Application Services.
- When external code mutates Aggregate internals or reads internals to decide state changes, move the operation behind root behavior.
- When a Repository becomes generic CRUD, table-shaped, row-returning, or starts enforcing business rules, reshape it around Aggregate access and move rules back to the model.
- When an event reads like a command, exposes framework or persistence artifacts, or describes a minor property change, rename, narrow, or remove it.
- When Application Services or controllers accumulate branching business rules, move the decision into the Entity, Value Object, Aggregate, or Domain Service that owns the concept.
- When client rendering, query speed, or representation needs pressure the model shape, use projections, DTOs, use-case queries, or adapters instead of enlarging or exposing Aggregates.
- When a subdomain is simple CRUD, keep it simple; when invariants and lifecycle complexity appear, model them honestly instead of hiding them in services.

## Final checklist

- Is the Bounded Context explicit before interpreting names, modules, events, repositories, APIs, persistence, or integrations?
- Does the code use one local term per concept across tests, commands, events, repositories, services, and packages?
- Is Core Domain effort protected while supporting or CRUD areas stay simpler?
- Are context relationships, translation responsibilities, and upstream/downstream pressures visible?
- Are Aggregates small, root-protected, invariant-driven, identity-linked, and usually one per transaction?
- Are Entities behavior-bearing and Value Objects immutable, validated, and value-equal?
- Are Repositories Aggregate-root access points rather than generic DAOs or ORM leaks?
- Are Domain Events meaningful past-tense facts, and is Event Sourcing used only when event history is the right persistence model?
- Are Application Services coordinating use cases instead of owning domain decisions?
- Are client, foreign, persistence, and infrastructure representations kept outside the local domain model?
