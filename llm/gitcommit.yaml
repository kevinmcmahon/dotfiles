  Write a descriptive commit following the Conventional Commits specification describing the changes in the following diff.
  Keep the commit message brief, but informative. Avoid stating the obvious. Focus on important changes a reviewer would care about.

  Think carefully before you write your commit message.

  Don't add fluff. No string delimiters wrapping it (like ```), no yapping, no markdown, no fenced code.
